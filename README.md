# accountPass
In this application, the program will provide a GUI interface to allow the user to type in a valid account number and a password in appropriate controls.  When the user clicks a Lookup button, the program will attempt to locate the account number in the input file.  If the account number is located successfully, the program will verify the password entered by the user matches exactly with the password stored in the input file.  If the password matches, the program will then display the security question stored for this account using an appropriate label and control.  The user will answer the security question and press a button for authorization.  The answer to the security question entered by the user must match exactly with the stored answer maintained in the input file.  The password and the security question's answer are case-sensitive so it will matter if the user does not match the case as stored in the random access file.   If the answers match, the user account information will be displayed. Be sure each control is properly labeled with the correct contents displayed.
